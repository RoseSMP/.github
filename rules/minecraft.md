# Minecraft server rules 
## Section 1: No griefing or stealing from other players' builds or containers.

Griefing refers to intentionally damaging or destroying other players' builds or items without their permission. This includes breaking blocks, placing blocks in a way that interferes with other players' builds, or taking items from another player's inventory without their consent.

Stealing refers to taking items from another player's inventory without their permission. This includes taking items from a chest, crafting table, furnace, or any other container that belongs to another player.

Players who are caught griefing or stealing will be punished according to the severity of their actions. This may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban.

Players are expected to respect the time and effort that other players put into their builds and items, and should only interact with them in a constructive and respectful manner. If you are unsure whether your actions may be considered griefing or stealing, it is best to stay on the side of caution and seek permission from the owner of the build or items before interacting with them.
## Section 2: No cheating, including the use of autoclickers, macros, hacked clients, or other third-party tools that give players an unfair advantage.

Cheating refers to the use of any third-party tools or techniques that give players an unfair advantage over other players. This includes the use of autoclickers, which are programs or physical hardware attachments that automatically click your mouse or perform other actions in the game, allowing players to perform tasks faster or more efficiently than they would be able to without the use of the program.

Macros are another form of cheating, as they allow players to automate complex sequences of actions, such as building entire structures or farming resources at an accelerated rate. Hacked clients are modified versions of the game's client software that include cheats or other features that are not available in the unmodified game.

Players who are caught using any form of cheating will be punished according to the severity of their actions. This may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban.

The use of mods or resource packs that do not give players an unfair advantage are generally allowed, but players should check with the server administrator before using any third-party modifications.

It is important to remember that cheating ruins the game for other players, and is not tolerated on RoseSMP. Players are expected to play the game fairly and honestly, and to respect the effort and skill of their fellow players.
## Section 3: No excessively offensive or inappropriate behaviour, including harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.

RoseSMP is a community-based server, and players are expected to behave in a respectful and considerate manner towards each other. This includes not engaging in excessively offensive or inappropriate behaviour that may be harmful or disruptive to other players.

Harassment refers to any behaviour that is intended to threaten, intimidate, or otherwise cause distress to another player. This may include repeated unwanted communication, insulting or degrading language, or any other behavior that is intended to hurt or offend another player.

Discrimination refers to any behavior that is based on another player's race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other personal characteristic. This includes making offensive or discriminatory comments or jokes, or treating other players unfairly because of their personal characteristics.

Hate speech refers to any speech or expression that promotes violence or discrimination against a particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristic. This is strictly prohibited on RoseSMP, and players who engage in hate speech will be punished according to the severity of their actions.
## Section 4: No excessive use of caps or spamming in chat.

Players are expected to communicate with each other in a respectful and considerate manner. This includes not using excessive caps or spamming in chat.

Excessive use of caps refers to writing entire messages or large portions of messages in all capital letters. This can be difficult to read and can be perceived as shouting or yelling, which can be disruptive or offensive to other players.

Spamming refers to sending multiple messages in quick succession that are not relevant or useful to the conversation. This can be disruptive and can make it difficult for other players to communicate with each other.

Players who engage in excessive use of caps or spamming in chat will be warned to stop. If they continue to do so, they may be punished according to the severity of their actions. This may include a temporary ban or permanent ban.
## Section 5: No advertising other servers or websites in chat.

Players are expected to focus on the community and their interactions with other players on the server. Advertising other servers or websites in chat can be disruptive and can take away from the community atmosphere on the server.

Players are not allowed to advertise other servers or websites in chat. This includes mentioning the name of another server or website, sharing a link to another server or website, or otherwise promoting another server or website.

There are certain exceptions to utility websites, such as rgb.birdflop.com, but must be checked with fizz#4096 first!

Players who are caught advertising other servers or websites in chat will be punished according to the severity of their actions. This may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban.
## Section 6: No exploitation of game bugs or glitches for personal gain.

Game bugs or glitches are unintended features or behaviours in the game that may give players an unfair advantage or allow them to gain access to items or features that they should not have access to. Exploiting these bugs or glitches for personal gain is considered cheating and is not allowed on RoseSMP.

Players who are caught exploiting game bugs or glitches for personal gain will be punished according to the severity of their actions. This may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban.

To report a bug on RoseSMP, players should contact a server administrator through the appropriate channels, such as the server's ticketing system. Players should provide as much information as possible about the bug, including the steps they took to reproduce it, any error messages they received, and any other relevant information.

Players should not attempt to exploit the bug for personal gain while it is being investigated. Instead, they should report the bug as soon as possible to help the server administrators fix the issue and prevent other players from exploiting it.

Server administrators will investigate the reported bug and take appropriate action, such as fixing the issue or punishing players who have exploited the bug for personal gain. Players who report bugs in a responsible manner may be rewarded for their contribution to the server.
## Section 7: No use of mods or resource packs that give players an unfair advantage.

Mods and resource packs are third-party modifications that can change the way the game looks or behaves. Some mods and resource packs can give players an unfair advantage, such as increased movement speed or access to 
features that are not available in the unmodified game.

Players are not allowed to use mods or resource packs that give them an unfair advantage on RoseSMP. This includes mods or resource packs that give players access to new features, or that make it easier to perform certain tasks in the game.

Players who are caught using mods or resource packs that give them an unfair advantage will be punished according to the severity of their actions. This may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban.
## Section 8: No building in or near other players' builds without their permission.

Players are expected to respect the time and effort that other players put into their builds. This includes not building in or near other players' builds without their permission.

Players should not build within a certain distance of another player's build without their permission, as this can interfere with the other player's build and disrupt the aesthetic of the area. If a player wants to build near another player's build, they should ask for permission first and respect the other player's decision.
## Section 9: No creation of malicious or harmful redstone contraptions.

Redstone contraptions are complex mechanisms that are built using the game's redstone and pistons mechanics. While these contraptions can be used for a variety of purposes, such as automatic farming or transportation systems, they can also be used to create traps or other harmful mechanisms.

Another example of a harmful redstone build would be a lag machine, which results in a permanent blacklist.

Players are not allowed to create malicious or harmful redstone contraptions on RoseSMP. This includes traps, hidden levers or buttons that trigger harmful events, which are intended to bait members into using, or any other redstone contraption that is intended to harm or disrupt other players.
